# tweet-predictor

This tweet predictor was part of a Suffolk University data science project. In this Project I analyze data from students and entrepreneurs in the Boston area and apply machine learning algorithms to try and predict whether any given tweet was made by a student or an entrepreneur.

Breakdown of the Project:

1. Folder StudentsData contains Tweets from students and entrepreneurs 
2. interpretData.py interprets and calculates various statiscics on the student and entrepreneur tweets.
3. Processing.py applies machine learning algorithms (clustering, random forest, and logistic regression)
